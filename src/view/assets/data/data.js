And we can send NFTs as Advertisements to particular NFT holders with high affinity. Examples: We sent commemorative participation NFTs only to those who attended Vtuber live music events.We sent out advertising NFTs at the time of the DVD/archival distribution release to make people aware of the DVD/archival distribution release. Marketing of Digital Ownership We believe Web3.0 is the era of digital ownership. So token-graph marketing is a marketing philosophy based on what people own in their Wallet. And this marketing cares more about privacy, we do not need cookies and other personal information. Our records on Astar and Shiden Network We distributed NFTs at a Vtuber's live performance (live venue & online distribution) with BGM. We set up NFT cards at an NFT art exhibition and distributed commemorative NFTs with them. We distributed commemorative NFTs with NFT cards and NFT Sealer at STEPN offline events.
